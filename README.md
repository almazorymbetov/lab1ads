Laboratory work 1
I decided to create 10 classes for each problem
problem no.1: there is loop that make a comparison between initial minimum element and next elements
problem no.2: I used also loop to sum all elements, and divide it by the length(number of elements) of array
problem no.3: there is a loop until i squared is less than or equal to n, but when the remainder will be equal to 0, then it returns false or composite
problem no.4: I wrote recursive method and considered situation when n=0 or n=1 (which means 0! or 1! = 0), and in other moments it returns n itself multiplicated to the function where we put n-1 till n=1
problem no.5: In the recursive function it considered moment when n=0 (then fibonacci number equals to 0), and used formula F=F(n-1)+F(n-2) (called these functions again)
problem no.6: This code with recursive function "power" have three situations: 1. when n=0, every number in the power of 0 will be 1. 2.when n is negative, then it returns 1 / a in the power of negative number, and 3. the number a will be multiplicated itself unless n will be equal to 0
problem no.7: 
problem no.8: 
problem no.9: 
problem no.10:
